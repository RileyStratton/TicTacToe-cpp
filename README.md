## Development Environment

* Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (IDE): This IDE provides rich support for c++ and includes all necessary tools for compliling and running C++.
* C++ (Programming Language): C++ is a low level programming language that gives strong control over hardware, making it a very efficient programming language.

## Future Work

* Stop the game from crashing when a letter is input, and instead display an error message
